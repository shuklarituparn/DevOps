# Systemd files

The init system is the most important process on the linux system with the PID 1. It manages all the services that run in the background on the linux system. A unit is nothing but a type of resource that systemd can manage for us.

1. `/etc/systemd/system`: This directory contains systemd unit files created or customized by the system administrator to configure and manage system services, targets, sockets, devices, mounts, and timers.

2. `/run/systemd/system`: This directory stores runtime unit files generated by systemd during system boot or runtime modifications, typically for transient services or units created dynamically during system operation.

3. `/lib/systemd/system`: This directory holds the base set of systemd unit files provided by the system distribution, serving as a repository of default configurations for system services, targets, sockets, devices, mounts, and timers.
