job1:
  stage: test
  script:
    - execute_script_1

job2:
  stage: test
  script:
    - execute_script_2
  allow_failure: true

job3:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - deploy_to_staging
  environment: staging



In this example, job1 and job2 run in parallel:

If job1 fails, jobs in the deploy stage do not start.
If job2 fails, jobs in the deploy stage can still start.





test_job_1:
  script:
    - echo "Run a script that results in exit code 1. This job fails."
    - exit 1
  allow_failure:
    exit_codes: 137

test_job_2:
  script:
    - echo "Run a script that results in exit code 137. This job is allowed to fail."
    - exit 137
  allow_failure:
    exit_codes:
      - 137
      - 255


Use allow_failure:exit_codes to control when a job should be allowed to fail. The job is allow_failure: true for any of the listed exit codes, and allow_failure false for any other exit code
