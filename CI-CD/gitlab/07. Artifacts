Use artifacts to specify which files to save as job artifacts. Job artifacts
are a list of files and directories that are attached to the job when it succeeds, fails, or always.

This example creates an artifact with .config and all the files in the binaries directory.

artifacts:
  paths:
    - binaries/
  exclude:
    - binaries/**/*.o


This example stores all files in binaries/, but not *.o files located in subdirectories of binaries/.
