stages

History

Use stages to define stages that contain groups of jobs. Use stage in a job to configure the job to run in a specific stage.

If stages is not defined in the .gitlab-ci.yml file, the default pipeline stages are:

.pre
build
test
deploy
.post

The order of the items in stages defines the execution order for jobs:

Jobs in the same stage run in parallel.
Jobs in the next stage run after the jobs from the previous stage complete successfully.
If a pipeline contains only jobs in the .pre or .post stages, it does not run. There must be at least one other job in a different stage. .pre and .post stages can be used in required pipeline configuration to define compliance jobs that must run before or after project pipeline jobs.

Example of stages:

stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy



stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

job1:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "This job compiles code."

job2:
  stage: test
  script:
    - echo "This job tests the compiled code. It runs when the build stage completes."

job3:
  script:
    - echo "This job also runs in the test stage".

job4:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - echo "This job deploys the code. It runs when the test stage completes."
  environment: production
