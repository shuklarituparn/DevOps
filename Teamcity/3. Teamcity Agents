    In teamcity cloud all the agents are managed for you (Below using docker image to build an agent)

    docker run -e SERVER_URL="http://public-ip:8111"  \                    # Where the agent should connect to
    -v team_city_agent_config_two:/data/teamcity_agent/conf  \             #Mounting the volume to store the config files
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \                         #Mounts the docker socket file to the contianer
                                                                            (this gives the container ability to talk to docker daemon)
    -v /usr/local/bin/docker:/usr/bin/docker \                             #Mounting the binary from the user computer to the one on docker
    -d jetbrains/teamcity-agent



NOTE: for docker mount to work and docker commands to be executable inside the container, you need to set less
      stricter permission on docker on the host with the following command

       chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock



ENV:

    To use the env variables in the docker, can use the parameters options in the project tab
