    In the example the project has the docker file so the agent will build it and push it to the docker registry

    Click configure build steps if want to define it manually

    Build Application -step name



2. Choose docker run to build docker image

    Step Name: Build Image

    Execute step: Constraint that we can set (to execute our pipeline only after a specific command)

    Docker command: We can define the docker command that we want to run (build, push or other)

    Dockerfile (path to file): We can select our dockerfile from this

    Image Name:tag := tag to push the image. Can use like shuklarituparn/myapp-9.0-%build.number%

                       (Here can actually provide multiple tags to build multiple images) - shuklarituparn/myapp-latest

    There is an option in teamcity to select the build parameters and its a good practice to use the build number



    Step Name: Push Image

        Execute step: Constraint that we can set (to execute our pipeline only after a specific command)

        Docker command: We can define the docker command that we want to run (build, push or other)

        Image Name:tag := tag to push the image. Can use like shuklarituparn/myapp-9.0-%build.number%

                           (Here can actually provide multiple tags to build multiple images) - shuklarituparn/myapp-latest

        There is an option in teamcity to select the build parameters and its a good practice to use the build number



To connect teamcity to other platforms

        1. Go to the project and then navigate to the connections

        2. There click add connection and then login to the platform that we want to use

        3. Now after the connection is successful, we need to go to the build and add build features

        4. And there add Docker Support and Add registery connection
