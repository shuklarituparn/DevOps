    1. Can write configuration as code and host it on VCS
    2. Can write this configuration as code in Kotlin

Build Chains:

    1. Sequence of the build as dependencies and can pass the artifacts
    2. Can run same build in parallel in different cloud provider for different os and then deploy it
    3. Personal build can be run direct from the IDE (useful to test changes before committing- using plugin)

Architecture:

    Main server:

    1. Central teamcity server: provides the UI for build config
    2. Build information and results

    Build Agents :

    1. Run build configurations
    2. Connect as many agents you want
    3. Can run on server, on premise etc.
    4. It automatically detects, which build agent can execute which build




How to setup:

    docker run \
    -v team_city_data:/data/teamcity_server/datadir \                                 #the volume to persist
    -v team_city_logs:/opt/teamcity/logs  \                                           #to store the logs, docker will create all these volumes
    -p 8111:8111 \                                                                    #port for the teamcity server
    -d jetbrains/teamcity-server                                                      #run in background so "-d" and the image
